•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client articulated their desire to produce a game based on a client/server paradigm that could effortlessly transition to diverse operating systems. Java's considerable versatility, notably attributable to its utilization of a runtime environment, renders it the probable programming language of choice.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

A notable misstep was combining three distinct versions instead of unifying multiple iterations into a coherent document. Consequently, this lapse served as a valuable reminder to meticulously scrutinize project specifications before commencing work diligently. On a positive note, my use of professional and creative language was met with acclaim. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

A vital aspect when working on any project is setting its foundation correctly. One document that aids this process is the design document, where everyone can define and understand client needs. With a detailed traceability matrix, developers can efficiently work towards meeting these expectations, making this an instrumental piece for successful project delivery.  

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

With hindsight I recognize that it would have likely been more advisable to meticulously revise every portion of the document and only then assign it an updated version number. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Our client holds tremendous value to us due to their unfathomable perception of what is necessary for a successful project outcome. As experienced professionals, we strive to grasp their objectives completely. Our effectiveness stems from our ability to provide suitable engineering resolutions devoid of any glitches.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My priority was to establish an encompassing behavioral and functional model for this software application. To achieve this goal, I recommended utilizing UML design tools that offer clear visual representations allowing us to collaborate better with peers such as project managers or developers by receiving constructive feedback. It's worth noting these resources are crafted based on prior clients' experiences, much like what we've encountered during this course, providing us with valuable lessons applicable within industry standards found in the private sector setting.
